Your task is to copy the file basic.cpp and optimize the program to run faster!
you cannot change what the program does, only how it does it. change too much
and the control number will start to change. your approach should be as follows
0. read this text file
1. study the program and find the major bottlenecks
2. sort the bottlenecks by approximate speedup potential
3. fix bottlenecks starting at the most potential speedup to the least
4. compile with "g++ -O0" to remove compiler optimizations

remember to use everything you have learned about pointers, memory assignment and 
such. you are allowed to use any tool or method to speed up the program. you may
work in teams or individually. you MAY NOT copy-paste code from the internet, that
would be very unsporting of you.

remember that you are optimizing not re-implementing! leave functions mostly alone.
you MAY change the RETURN TYPE or PARAMETER of the function

the included testing script will be used to time everyones submissions for the grand
competition!


the benchmarks for the starter programs are as follows:
    ryzen 1700x workstation running linux 5.4 compiled with g++ 9.2.0: 1.1301s over 10 attempts
