The villain from the python task boss_battle has returned
but now has the power of bad code on his side! Implement a 
spell for the hero to use to defeat the villain. Implement
the cast function in the Fireball.cpp file to deal enough
damage (without cheesing it) to defeat the horrible villain!

After this is done you will be pretty familiar with the 
Fireball and Character classes, implement a new spell:
Holy_heal which heals a target so our poor hero can recover
then you can implement whatever other kind of spell sounds fun.

REMEMBER! by default a character can only remember one spell at
a time! a new Character object needs to be created for every
spell you want to try. The syntax is no different from a vector.

NOTE ON CODE QUALITY! this would preferrably have been accomplished
with a Spell object that Fireball and Holy_heal inherit, that way 
Characters could cast any spell that inherits the Spell class.
However the trade-off is that it would have made the basic task
a bit harder to explain. If you want to, implement a Spell base
class that Fireball and Holy_heal inherits from!
