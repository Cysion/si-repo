in this task you will implement conways "game of life" using a
Grid object that has pre-built methods for printing the matrix required
the game of life is a grid-based simulation experiment that shows the
progression of lifeforms in an area. the game has no interaction from any
player and is simply run in a loop on the computer where the next game-state
depends only on the previous. so the same start always has the same outcome.

in the game each "square" on the grid is called a cell, and has two states:
    alive or dead
there are also some rules that are applied simultaniously to every cell in
the grid every loop (called a generation):
    any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies
    any cell with two or three live neighbours lives
    any cell with more than three live neighbours dies
    any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell
and thus the game-state of the next generation is determined.

you will implement the function gollogic to run these rules on a 2-dimensional
list. You can if you wish include stats tracking to display live/dead cell 
count and more.

it is recommended that you run solution.py without loking at the code to see what
a final implementation might look like!
