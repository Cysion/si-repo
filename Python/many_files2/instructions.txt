[NOTE: SOLUTION INCOMPLETE OR MISSING!]
[Moderatly advanced level!]
In this exercise we will be
practicing more advanced 
operations like hashing and
useful libraries! 

your task 
is to once again recursively
traverse all files and
directories in the 'files'
directory but this time
add all sub directories as a
dictionary to a dictionary 
and all files with their
corresponding sha256sum!
like so:
{
    "directory0":{
        "directory0":{
            "directory0":{
                "6f3g4f":"4389fe3ccac41e09012eadb30e8d7e1b685a9ffa0ea12ff43cb0e803b95384ac"
                "egbc":"ea73671e697d750511fc00b7d532fc89aba7c495d2c6bfee1ac2059c3fdfd71a"
            }
            .
            .
            .
        }
        .
        .
        .
    }
    .
    .
    .
}

then once you have created the
dictionary i want you to use the
json library to create a json file!
start by reading in the online
documentation how to use the 
json.dump() method!

once that is done i want you to
read the file as binary and hash
that value, all going well you may
arrive at the same value as me,
but there is a large chance you wont
even if you did everything right due
to the inherent randomness of 
dictionaries
