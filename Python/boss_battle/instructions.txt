Your job is to take input from a user and handle 
any bad inputs gracefully with try-except. You are 
given a starting point with some code to run the
combat. You will interact with the "fight" object
as an interface to a "character" object, but not
the character object directly. you will use the
method "take_turn" in the "fight" object for this
interaction. fight.take_turn() takes 3 arguments:

    who is doing something (in your case "hero")
    what are they doing (ex "boomerang throw")
    who are they doing it to (ex "villain")

You will take user input and handle any exceptions
that occur inside one or several try-except statements.
you will also handle most of the user interfaceand 
show them adequate information.
things to consider:
    cooldowns to your abilities (found in hero.cooldowns)
    status effects (found in fight.statuses)
